1 hour 30 minutes

## Execution

### Run


#### Local

##### Requirements

Go (version 1.13 or higher recommended)

- Clone this repository to local machine.
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Run the program using the following command:

```sh
  go mod tidy
  go run main.go
```
Here the command *go mod tidy* installs any libs necessary for the project to build. We are not using any third party library here. Only standard libs bundled with golang is used.

The program will process the hardcoded JSON string in the main function and output the transformed JSON to the console.

#### Replit Setup and Execution Instructions

- Go to Replit and create a new repl.
- Choose "Go" as the language.
- In the "Import from GitHub" field, paste the URL of this GitHub repository.
- Once the repl is created, we should see the main.go file in the file explorer.
- We can directly run the code by clicking on Run or in shell:
  ``` go run main.go```
